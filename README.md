An Online Complaint System tailored for a power plant environment is a specialized internal platform designed to streamline and centralize the process of reporting, tracking, and resolving issues across various departments.
Core Description:
An Online Complaint System for a Power Plant is a web-based or internal network application that enables any authorized employee (the complainant) to formally log an issue or request for attention directed at another specific department (the responsible department) or a specific team/individual within the plant. It serves as a digital bridge between departments, facilitating seamless communication and accountability for problem resolution.
Key Features and Functionality:
Centralized Complaint Submission:

User-Friendly Interface: Employees can easily log in and submit complaints through a simple form.
Detailed Information Capture: Fields for:
Complaint Type: (e.g., Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, IT, HR, Safety, C&I, Quality, Stores).
Originating Department: The department reporting the issue.
Target Department: The department responsible for addressing the issue.
Location: Specific plant area, equipment ID, or building.
Description: Detailed explanation of the problem, including urgency and impact.
Attachments: Ability to upload photos or documents (e.g., images of faulty equipment, hazard notices).
Contact Information: Of the complainant for follow-up.
Date and Time Stamp: Automatic recording of when the complaint was logged.
Automated Routing & Assignment:

Based on the selected "Complaint Type" and "Target Department," the system automatically routes the complaint to the relevant team or individual.
Rules can be configured to assign complaints to specific personnel based on department, shift, or expertise.
Real-time Tracking & Status Updates:

Complainants can view the real-time status of their logged complaints (e.g., "New," "Assigned," "In Progress," "Pending Parts," "Closed").
Responsible departments can update the status as they work on the issue.
Timestamping of status changes provides a clear audit trail.
Communication & Collaboration Tools:

Internal Notes/Comments: Departments can communicate internally on a complaint, sharing updates, asking questions, or noting progress.
Notifications: Automated email or SMS alerts to relevant parties (complainant, assigned personnel, supervisors) upon submission, status change, or closure.
Resolution & Closure Workflow:

Once an issue is resolved, the responsible department marks the complaint as "Closed," often with a detailed resolution description.
The complainant might have the option to confirm satisfactory closure or re-open the complaint if the issue persists.
Reporting and Analytics:

Department-wise summary of total, attended, and pending complaints.
Complaint type trends (e.g., recurring electrical issues, frequent IT requests).
Average resolution times.
Performance metrics for different departments.
Identification of bottlenecks or recurring problems.
Helps in identifying areas for process improvement, resource allocation, and proactive maintenance planning.
User Authentication & Role-Based Access:
